# DeepX-GAN
The code repo for the paper "Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling" (not officially published yet). A preprint of this manuscript is available on arXiv at [arXiv: 2507.09211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211). 

This repository is still under active development. Please note that the code has not been fully documented or annotated yet. We are sharing this version to accompany our manuscript and to promote transparency and reproducibility. Variable names and function structures may change, and detailed comments are still being added. Future updates will include improved documentation and cleaner structure.

The example dataset is shared on Google Drive due to GitHub's file size limit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jWOCox6btoBEMG6vLkh_Qv_YUZuSSJ9f/view?usp=sharing.
